Content Provider Generator
=======================
With this project you are able to generate all the necessary code for
a ContentProvider that can be used by any android application.  The 
generation is based on a datbase schema JSON definition file.  This project
also provides the possibility to generate this JSON definition file from
an existing SQL Server database.
